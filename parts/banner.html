            <h1>Is America Great Yet?</h1>
            <p class="button primary fit large">NO</p>
        </header>
        <p>Starting during the political campaigns running up to the Federal election of 2016, a new political slogan emerged: "Make America Great Again," or "MAGA".  Naturally, this leads to an evaluatory counter-question: <strong>Is America Great Yet?</strong>  Unfortunately, the current answer is <strong>no.</strong></p>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to create scorecards on a number of topics and issues that can be evaluated to assess progress for, or against, America's greatness. We will highlight areas in which the country desperately needs reform to truly achieve greatness.</p>
        <p>Our goal is to foster awareness of systemic issues separating the United States of America from its potential as a nation.  Organized loosely by topic, we will break down some of the problems America has yet to solve, and provide sources for any factual claims made on the site.</p>
        <p>We realize the "Is America Great Yet?" is an excellent question, but a terrible acronym: IAGY.</p>
        <p>The creator of this site is a nationalized US citizen (born: Canada) who moved from NYC to live and work in Tokyo, Japan in 2015 and is motivated to create this list as they consider where they should move next in the world.</p>
