This is a todolist of items I don't want to forget about:

* Fix the topics layout to display sub-topics
* Create an HTML sitemap
* Fix the sidebar to link to topics, etc
* Add ratings template / visualizations (d3js)
* Enhance subpages with enough metadata to show a scoreboard on the front page
* Link "no" to a special one-page everything view
* Get Jekyll to actually build/use the _sass from the template instead of using the pre-cooked ones
* Create favicons
* Fix jQuery security issue
* Upgrade to latest font-awesome
